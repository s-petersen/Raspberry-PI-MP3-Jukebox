
To run the program without a sound card (on a Pi zero)
you add this line in config.txt
dtoverlay=pwm-2chan,pin=18,func=2,pin2=13,func2=4
with the schematic provided

you need the line in config.txt
dtoverlay=gpio-shutdown,gpio_pin=3
to make the power button shut the pi down gracefully

mplayer needs to be installed to use this program

The usb drive needs to be mounted on /home/pi/jukebox (make the directory,and use that as a mount point) (you could also change the paths in the programs)
One problem with using the desktop version is that the usb drive is only mounted at desktop startup, so cron jobs will not see the usb until it's too late.

The Queue.csv needs to exist in the root of the usb drive to run the program, create an empty file if nessesary

The music directories are Red and Blue, their subdirectories are labeled as the consolette (number letter) combinations A1, C3 etc...
Drop any mp3 music file in one of those directories, and make a title strip to go with it

the following needs to be added to crontab to run headless
@reboot sudo /home/pi/jukebox/./jukebutns5.py & #button decoder, Queue.csv writer
@reboot sudo /home/pi/jukebox/./jukeboxply.py & #Queue.csv reader, mp3 player
@reboot sudo /home/pi/jukebox/./skipsong.py &   #skip songs

add to fstab to prevent sdcard wearout

tmpfs    /tmp            tmpfs    defaults,noatime,nosuid,size=100m    0 0
tmpfs    /var/tmp        tmpfs    defaults,noatime,nosuid,size=30m    0 0
tmpfs    /var/log        tmpfs    defaults,noatime,nosuid,mode=0755,size=100m    0 0
tmpfs    /var/runxx        tmpfs    defaults,noatime,nosuid,mode=0755,size=2m    0 0

disable swapfile
sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff
sudo dphys-swapfile uninstall
sudo update-rc.d dphys-swapfile remove
sudo apt purge dphys-swapfile

Disable rainbow screen

disable_splash=1 in config.txt

A 4gig sd card works for stretch lite, a 2 gig usb is fine for the music and programs this are running on a Pi Zero

If a static access point is desired the following files need to be modified, the internet connection is lost.
wpa_supplicant.conf
dhcpcd.conf
dnsmasq.conf
hostapd
hostapd.conf



My Jukebox is at 10.10.10.1 and can be logged into from anywhere in my 1st floor.
